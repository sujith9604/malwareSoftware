## Introduction
This project aims to simulate the behavior of a malicious software program, named V.cpp, which acts as a virus and a worm within the Linux environment. The program is written in C++ and demonstrates how malware can modify files, propagate through connected USB drives, and auto-run on new devices.

## Description
V.cpp searches for files with the .foo extension in the user's ~/Documents folder and appends its contents to all the .foo files found. Additionally, it scans for .foo files in connected USB drives and auto-runs itself upon connection to a new device, behaving like a worm.

## Security Implications
The actions of V.cpp introduce significant security concerns:
1. **File Integrity and Confidentiality:** Modifying files in critical directories poses risks to data integrity and confidentiality.
2. **Propagation and Spread:** Similar to traditional viruses, V.cpp can cause widespread infection and data loss by infecting files on local machines and connected USB drives.
3. **Unauthorized Replication:** The auto-run feature enables unauthorized distribution and proliferation of the program on new devices.
4. **Potential Exploitation:** V.cpp could serve as a template for creating more sophisticated malware, exploiting its file system traversal and propagation capabilities.
5. **Disruption of System Functionality:** File infection and modification can disrupt system functionality, leading to data corruption and application failures.

## Detection and Prevention
Antivirus programs can detect and prevent V.cpp using signature-based detection, heuristic analysis, and behavioral monitoring methods.

## Conclusion
V.cpp serves as an educational tool to explore the workings of malicious software. Understanding such threats is crucial for cybersecurity awareness and proactive measures to mitigate risks associated with malware propagation and exploitation in personal and organizational contexts.
